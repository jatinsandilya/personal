# Here‚Äôs a little sneak peek at my body of work üõ†Ô∏è

## Senior Software Engineer

(April 2021 - Feb 2021)

Flux is building the Figma for Hardware. It's a design tool for hardware engineers to build PCBs, Schematics, and Simulate circuits online.

- I built the first versions of selection controls on the Schematic Editor as well as the PCB editor in 2D & 3D. Handled single select, multi-select, and deep-select along with other nuances.
- I also researched & wrote the implementation of Alignment guides & Snapping of objects in the Schematic Editor after multiple iterations.
- Fixed performance issues by using the chrome & react profiler almost every day.

## Founder

(October 2020 - April 2021)

Flowdash is a low-code tool that allows web-based businesses to add an onboarding flow in their app in minutes instead of hours & days, **code-free**.

- Built the product from the ground up for **React Native** and **JS SDKs**. Wrote the React app to allow users to build & iterate on an experience and publish live.
- Built the backend to support experimental % rollout as well as to personalize on **user traits**.
- Did **sales calls**, **product** **demos**, customer conversations, and **SEO competitive analysis.**
- Ran the business as a **solo-founder fully bootstrapped**.
- Decided to ultimately sunset the business due to the following problems:
  1. The market being over-crowded.
  2. Attacking the wrong segment.
  3. Took the Solution in Search of a problem (SISP) approach instead of leading with the problem.
  4. Got traction with a few companies using us but the traction wasn't enough to keep me going.
